2. Wide variety of endpoints. We currently have `35` of them.

3. Our API is fully SFW. You will never worry about NSFW/lewd images or GIFs.

4. Organized assets. Images and GIFs are separated based by their category.

5. Fast response times and 99.9% uptime. For projects that stability and performance matters.

6. CORS is enabled for those who want to use our collection on their websites.

7. Crediting creators of their work is very important for us. That's why you get everything you need about the origin of the images and GIFs.
